# Business-Website
A business website for a fictional company
# index.html
I wanted to make a "newsletter" since many coffee company websites I looked at had newsletters for information on new flavors, roasts, etc.
I thought the pop of color to the sections of information would bring attention to them, but I feel like in the long run, I might want to change them or add more style
For the navbar, I wanted to make something simple and not too over the top. Many companies used a solid darker color and I chose to do the same.
# menu.html
For the Menu, I chose 6 different drinks to display and I wanted to include pictures of what they would look like "in store"
The design/arrangement is supposed to mirror a gallery, with many options available and different perspectives of the coffees in store
Due to an issue in the code, I could not figure out how to arrange the images horizontally, so they are alligned vertically until I find a fix
# ourStory.html
I used an AI to fill out the text for the story and changed some details to personalize the words/stories
I wanted this page to be simple and just outline the current story of the coffee shop, since I saw other websites do the same
# contactUs.html
For the Contact Us page, I wanted to do something similar to the first page by mentioning and haviung a form for the newsletter
I added a contact form so customers could keep in touch and submit questions if needed
I created a fake address using a real street and zip code in Arizona, since Arizona ties into many of the ideas for this coffeehouse
# As a whole
As a whole, I wanted to keep the website simple and not use too many distracting colors, since many websites I checked out kept a simple design, and those that didn't felt like there were too many distractors from the coffee/information
